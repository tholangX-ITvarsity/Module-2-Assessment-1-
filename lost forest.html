                    <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                    <p> The Lost Forest has extensive trails, winding through exhibits and aviaries.  These trails are home to animals from the rainforests of Asia and Africa, and wind their way up into the canopy as well as along the forest floor, with arboreal animals displayed above and ground dwellers below.</p>
                      
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>The lost forest is just right of the monkey trail course.</p>
