                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, sometimes panda bear or simply panda) is a bear species endemic 
                        to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is 
                        sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order 
                        Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. 
                        Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or 
                        carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with 
                        specially prepared food.</p>
                       <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring 
                        Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been 
                        driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 
                        report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. By December 
                        2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 countries. Wild population 
                        estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006 study 
                        via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that the 
                        number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. By March 2015, the wild giant panda population had increased 
                        to 1,864 individuals. In 2016, it was reclassified on the IUCN Red List from "endangered" to "vulnerable", 
                        affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also reclassified the giant panda 
                        as vulnerable.</p>
                        <p>The giant panda has often served as China's national symbol, appeared on Chinese Gold Panda coins since 1982 
                            and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics.</p>
